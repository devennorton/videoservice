Hello Sparkies!

So a quick tour around is in order I suppose.

  * the src folder is where you'll find all the scripts that do things for you.
    * comment.rb, search.rb, and upload.rb, all perform simple and obvious tasks yt.rb is a bit fancier if more obscure (it uses switches)
  * the lib folder contains all the code for talking to the service as well as some helper code for managing multipart http posts
  * the test folder can be pretty much ignored theres a stub for writing some unit tests in there its auto generated but I left it in in the hopes that one day I would write some unit tests for this.
